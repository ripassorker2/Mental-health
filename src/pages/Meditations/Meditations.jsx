                                and balance that can benefit your emotional

                                use it to relax and cope with stress by focusing
                                on something that calms you. Meditation can help
                                you learn to stay centred and keep inner peace.

                                meditation, there exist various mindfulness
                                techniques employing different focal points to
                                anchor our attention. These can include external
                                objects like sounds in the environment or
                                broader practices such as observing spontaneous
                                thoughts during aimless wandering. Despite their
                                differences, all these practices share a common
                                goal to bring awareness to the fact that our
                                minds often dominate our experiences. Indeed,
                                our thoughts tend to lead to actions. Here are
                                some useful strategies to shift this dynamic:

                                <b>Counting Meditation</b>: Sit quietly and
                                count your breaths. Inhale, then silently count
                                "one" as you exhale. Inhale again and count
                                "two" on the next exhale, and continue counting
                                up to a predetermined number, such as ten. If
                                you lose count or your mind wanders, simply
                                start again from one.
